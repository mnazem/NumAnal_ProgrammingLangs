This is a research project that aims to compare the efficiency of some popular programming languages and numerical libraries applied to advanced computational engineering and numerical analysis. With this as the main purpose, the project will hopefully produce some coding receipes in different programming languages for some popular algorithms/methods/routines in the field of computational engineering and numerical analysis.
